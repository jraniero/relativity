<p align="justify">This movie simulates the set-up used in the Michelson-Morley 
  experiment, including the <font color="#FF0000"><strong>non-existent</strong></font> 
  aether wind they were trying to detect! The basic idea is to detect the time 
  difference between light going &quot;upstream then downstream&quot; and light 
  going &quot;across shore and back.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Rotating the apparatus exchanges these two routes: set the apparatus 
  direction by clicking on the center circle in the control, fine adjustment with 
  +, -.</p>
<p align="justify">Due to the limitations of Flash, the stepwise increment cannot 
  be smaller than 0.05 pixels. So the ratio of light speed to aether speed as portrayed here cannot be anywhere near 10,000, the order of magnitude M & M expected to find. To make our animation look more like the expected outcome of the original experiment, we have cheated by not taking into account the effect of the aether wind on the <I>direction</I> of motion of the light, but only including its effect on the <I>speed</I> of the light. The point of this animation is to illustrate the <I>idea</I> behind M & M's experiment, not to give a quantitative representation.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, we are still working on the Flash code -- currently round-off errors cause some small discrepancies at high values of the light speed. <I>Michael Fowler</I></p>
